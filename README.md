## Hello World

👋 Hi, I’m @MartinSpiguel and I'm 18 years old. I love math and technology is my passion.   
  
👀 I’m interested in programming, more specifically in python but really anything related to programming.   
  
🌱 I’m currently learning about data analysis and data science.
  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can. I'm interested in a lot of things. I'd love to get a job as a junior python programer/data analyst.
